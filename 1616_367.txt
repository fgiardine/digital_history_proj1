"_October 8._--We went to vizet the counsellars againe, to have our"
"dispach in remembrance. And first to Oyen Dono, the secretary, whoe"
"tould us that we should speake to Codgskin Dono, for that he could do"
"nothing of hym selfe. Unto which I answerd that the rest did refer us"
"to hym, and therefore I besought his Lordship to procure our dispach;"
"for I stood in dowbt my long staying and want of sales of our goodes"
"per meanes of this edict would be an occation I should not send away"
"our 2 shipps and junck this yeare, which would be a borthen to hevie"
"for us to beare or to answer to our employers. He said he would doe"
"what he could and take councell with the rest what might be donne. So"
"from thence we went to Codgskin Dono, whome the servantes tould us was"
"in the house. Yet could I not come to speech of hym, but lost my errant"
"with his cheefe men."

"I forgot to note downe that Safian Dono was at the secretaries howse,"
"siting in a darke corner, I being cald in and apointed to syt on the"
"better hand of hym, not knowing whoe he was till Capt. Adames tould me,"
"which then I went on the other side and craved pardon as not knowing"
"hym. In fyne, every one complayneth that matters are worse then in the"
"ould mans daies, and that this man doth nothing but change offecers and"
"displace _tonos_, sending and changing one into an others contrey; so"
"that much grudging is at it and all in law and plitos on with an other,"
"so that what will com of it God knoweth, for, as the comon report is,"
"no man dare speake to the Emperour of any matter they think is to his"
"discontent, he is so furious, and no meanes but death or distruction."
"So that what will come of us or our sute I know not, for I tell them it"
"were as good for the Emperour to banish us all out of Japon as to shut"
"us up in Firando, it being a place of no sales."
