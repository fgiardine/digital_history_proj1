"_August 6._--I hearing the sea _bongew_ was gon up to the king, and"
"dowbting he might enforme untruthes against my _jurebasso_, was"
"determined to have written 2 letters, 1 to the king, and another to"
"Chumba Dono, my _jurebassos_ ould master, to desire them not to geve"
"eare to his enemies falce reportes; but, as I was about to have donne"
"it, Tackamon Dono sent unto me his cheefe man, be being accompanied"
"with Skidayen Dono and Nicolas Martin, his _jurebasso_. And his desire"
"was that, for his sake, I would geve over the pursute of this matter"
"against the sea _bongew_, for that, yf it were followed, of force the"
"said _bongew_ must cut his bellie, and then my _jurebasso_ must do the"
"lyke. Unto which his request I was content to agree, and afterward"
"went to geve hym thankes for the paynes he had taken in the matter,"
"he having promised me that non should be so hardy to meddell with my"
"_jurebasso_ hereafter, and that he would take the matter in hand to"
"make the accord betwixt hym and his wife."
""
"And from Tacaman Donos, I went to the Duch howse, where, amongst other"
"matters, we fell into discourse about the _bongews_ proceedinges"
"against my _jurebasso_, he taking the _bongews_ part, and tould me he"
"had donne well yf he had cut hym in peeces the other [day], and then"
"their would have byn no more words therof afterward. But I made hym"
"answer that it might be he was deceaved in that, for that I would have"
"brought the matter in question, and it might be would have cost both"
"hym and others their lives, for that all the justice of Firando said"
"that the _bongew_ had donne that which he could not answer. Once I"
"fownd my selfe agreeved that he had me in soe small respect that he,"
"without geveing notis unto me, sent craftely for my _jurebasso_ out"
"of my howse, thinking to have put hym to death without any forme of"
"processe; and he replid and said that the _bongew_ was a souldier, and"
"stood upon his honer more than his lyfe, and card not to cut his belly"
"upon such an occation. I answered, I did not esteem this _bongew_ such"
"a personage that he needed to take pepper in the nose soe much as he"
"did."

"I forgot to note downe how I carid a jarr of China beare and 5 stringes"
"drid fish to Tacamon Dono for a present."
""
"This _bongew_ and Capt. Speck are all one, and I know this trowble"
"against my _jurebasso_ came, the beginning of it, from the Duch howse."
""
"Capt. Speck came late to the English howse, and Sr. Matias with hym,"
"and desired my company to goe and see a peece of ordinance cast; which"
"I did, but marveled at their workmanship. For they carid the mettell in"
"ladells above 20 yardes from the place where the mould stood, and soe"
"put it in, ladelfull after ladell, and yet made as formall ordinance as"
"we doe in Christendom, both of brasse and iron. Capt. Speck tould me"
"nether workmanship nor stuffe did not stand hym in halfe the price it"
"cost them in Christendom."

"Capt. Speck tould me he receaved a barks lading of copper this day from"
"Sackay, and that his barke departed from thence 3 daies after Mr. Eaton"
"was departed from thence. God send hym hither in saffety."

"And we bought 22 bags rise of Zazabra Dono for 4 _gantes_ a _masse_,"
"and delivered 12 bagges of them to our ship carpenters upon accompt."
"They beging to work upon our junk to morrow. God be their good speed,"
"etc."
