"And I thought good to note downe that in the way from Miaco our host"
"shewed us the preparatives made for the buriall of the ould _dyrie_"
"(or pope) of Japon, viz.:--In one howse was set a rood or shrine of"
"marvelose lardgnes, with, to my thinking, 100 pillers gilded over"
"with gould, with each of them a gilded crowne on the top of them, and"
"rownd about the howse, against the pillers, a gilded skuchin hanged"
"up, which, as I learned, represented all the provinces or kingdoms in"
"Japon, over which he houldeth hym selfe king of kings. Also against"
"each piller stood a candelstick with a wax taper. But yow must"
"understand there was an other howse, built highe and 4 square, not far"
"from this first with the shrine, in the midest wherof was a dipe hole"
"very fairely plastered, over which a greate vessell of wood was to be"
"placed, wherin the body of the _dirie_ was to be put, and the valt"
"under filled with sweete odors and pretious woods, which being set on"
"fire burne the vessells, corps, howse, and all the rest; with 4 gates"
"made E., W., N., and S., walled about a pretty distance from the howse,"
"all being hanged about with white silk which was to be consumed with"
"the rest."
""
"The greate wooden vessell I saw in a pagod not far from the place"
"wheare the body was to be burned, which pagod was fownded per the said"
"_daire_. The vessell in forme was made lyke a lantarne, set out with"
"pinacles of excellent workmanship, all being gilded over with gould."
""
"The top of the howse where he was to be burned was painted with the"
"formes of angells, som with instrumentes of musick and others with"
"garlandes, as it were to crowne hym. And they verely think that, when"
"the body is consumed, the sole flieth directly for heaven, haveing"
"liberty to passe out at any of the 4 gates, eather E., W., N., or S."
