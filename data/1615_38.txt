"_July 7._--Here is reports that the Emperour hath staid the King of"
"Shashma and all the _tonos_ of these partes, and pretendeth to shifte"
"them out of their governmentes (or kingdoms), and put them into other"
"provinces to the northward, and them of the northern parts in their"
"places. But I rather (in parte) esteem it to be the escape of Fidaia"
"Samme, whoe may ly in secret in som of their cuntries, expecting"
"opertunety and their retorns; which to prevent, he keepeth them by hym"
"till he can understand the certen truth whether he be alive or dead."
""
"We had newes that all men that entred into Langasaque were staid theare"
"and not sufferd to retorne out of the towne. The reason is thought to"
"be to look out for such as came out of the fortrese of Osekey; but I"
"rather esteem it to be to serche out Fidaia Samme, which is thought to"
"be escaped."
""
"Also, one of the king (or _tonos_) men of this place came and tould me"
"that his master had sent for 15 or 20 men of these partes to com unto"
"hym, which maketh me now verely to think that he will be shifted out of"
"his government or kingdom."
