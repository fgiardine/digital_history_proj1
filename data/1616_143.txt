"_September 12._--In respect we are put affe from day to day and canot"
"have our dispach, I got Capt. Adames to goe to Oyen Dono, the Emperours"
"secretary, accompanied with our _bongew_ and Goresano our _jurebasso_,"
"to geve hym to understand, yf he make any dowbt of the matter, that we"
"are no frendes of the Jesuistes nor fryres, nether suffer any of their"
"sect to remeane in England, but punish all them which are fownd with"
"death; this coarse haveing byn kept in England for above the space of"
"60 yeares, so that the Emperour needed not feare our conversation with"
"that sect, for that their hatred against us and our religion was more"
"then against any others whatsoever."

"Oyen Dono the secretary used Capt. Adames kyndly, and tould hym and"
"the other 2 how the Emperour was much offended against the padres, and"
"therefore advized us not to have conversation with them nor to let them"
"christen any children of ours, yf we chanced to have any, for then they"
"might presume we were of their sect, whome the Emperour ment utterly to"
"extinguish out of Japon. He willed Capt. Adames not to think it long we"
"were not dispached, the Emperours busyness being such as yet it could"
"not be done, but within a day or 2 he hoped to end it to our content."
