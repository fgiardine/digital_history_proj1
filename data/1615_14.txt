"in bars of Lucas Antoinsons, containing seven hundred forty and eight"
"_taies_ in bars and _fibuck_.[70] And I delivered fyftie _taies_ in"
"plate of barse to Mr. Nealson. And I receved two _cattis_ of amber"
"greese of Mr. Ric. Wickham, which he bought for the Worshipfull Company"
"at Liquea. And I receved 3 letters from Capt. Adames, how Damian Marin"
"set hym at nought and wold not shew hym any amber; so I retorned hym"
"answer not to let hym cary his chist ashore, but to bring it to the"
"English howse, which Capt. Adames did, but Damian came not with it."
