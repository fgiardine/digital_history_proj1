"_July 21._--The kinges brother, Tonomon Samme, sent for me to make"
"an end of my processe with the scrivano of Giquan, whome I fownd"
"accompanid with the boateswane of the junk and the China, Giquans"
"kynsman, with an other fello who cleamed 120 _picos_ sappon of our"
"wood, but had no papers to shew, but tould a longe Canterbury tale. But"
"this Jno. a Nokes was sowne sent away. The China desird restetution of"
"the junk, and that the scrivano should deliver the dead mans goodes"
"unto hym. But I shewed bills that I had right both to the one and"
"other, and desired the scrivano might deliver those goodes to me, as"
"also 42 _picos_ sappon yet wanting of the cupplement. So we weare all"
"dismissed and attend the conclution. I forgot to note down that the"
"China brought a _jurebasso_ with hym who spoke the Japon tonge, and I"
"shewing them ij bills I had in the China tong, this fello spake to the"
"_jurebasso_ to say they were not made as they ought to be, and that it"
"might passe because none of us knew the China tong; but the _jurebasso_"
"reproved hym. I think the reason was because he was much in feare to"
"fall into danger per any occation."
