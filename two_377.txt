"_October 18._--We dyned this day at a towne called Camacra,[191] which"
"in tymes past (500 yeares since) was the greatest cittie in Japon, and"
"(as it is said) 4 tymes bigger then Miaco or Edo is at present, and the"
"_tono_ or kyng of that place, called ----[192], was cheefe commander or"
"Emperour in Japon, and the cheefe (or first) that took the authoretie"
"royall from the _Daire_ who was the suckcessor to Shacke. But now at"
"present it is no cittie, but scattared howses seated heare and theare"
"in pleasant valles betwixt divers mountaines, wherin are divers pagods"
"very sumptuouse and a nunry (or rather a stews) of shaven women.[193]"
"I did never see such pleasant walkes amongst pyne and spruce trees as"
"are about these pagods, espetially 5 of them are more renowned then the"
"rest."
""
"But that which I did more admire then all the rest was a might[y] idoll"
"of bras, called by them Dibotes,[194] and standeth in a vallie betwixt"
"2 mountaynes, the howse being quite rotten away, it being set up 480"
"years past. This idoll is made siting cros legged (telor lyke) and yet"
"in my opinion it is above 20 yardes hie and above 12 yardes from knee"
"to knee. I doe think there may above 30 men stand within the compas of"
"the head. I was within the hollownes of it, and it is as large as a"
"greate howse. I doe esteem it to be bigger then that at Roads, which"
"was taken for 1 of the 7 wonders of the world, and, as report goeth,"
"did lade 900 camells with the ruens therof. But for this, it is thought"
"3000 horses would nothing neare carry away the copper of this. In fine,"
"it is a wonderfull thinge."
""
"Som report this cittie to be destroid with fire and brimston; but I"
"enquired of the enhabetantes, and they say they never heard of any such"
"matter but only that it was burned and ruenated by war."
""
"From Camacora we went to Fugesao[195] to bed; and paid for diet, night"
"and mornyng, 2 _ichibos_, and to servantes in the howse 200 _gins_."
