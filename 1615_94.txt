"_September 2._--I got barks to goe out to tow our shipp into harbor, yf"
"it were possible, much fearing a tuffon; and Capt. Copendall and Mr."
"Eaton went aboard to hasten matters forward and, yf the shipp came not"
"in, to bring aland our Cambaia cloth and other comodetis, to the entent"
"to lay out the present for the Emperor, and make as much hast as we"
"can, not to be overlong behinde the Hollanders. But the wind proving"
"so hard, we could nether get ship into harbor nor bring goods ashore,"
"Capt. Copendall and Mr. Eaton remeanyng all night abord. God send us"
"wether to bring her in this dangerous tyme of the yeare."

"We looked out for a bark to goe up in to the Emperour, but could find"
"non but ould rotten ons, all being above with the king but one which"
"the Hollanders had gotten before we asked. So we sent to Sanguro Dono,"
"Foins sonne, som 4 or 5 leagues hence, to borrowe a bark of his."
