"_September 19._--We went to the Admerall yonger, Shongo Dono, and carid"
"hym a present. And Capt. Adames gave hym 3 gilt Syam skins and a tigers"
"skyn. He took our visitasion kyndly, and offerd us to do for our nation"

"the Emperour did not make such, haveing both men (I meane workmen),"
"tymber, and all thinges else necessary. Yt seemed to me that he tooke"
"notis hereof."
