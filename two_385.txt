"_October 26._--We broake fast at Mia,[211] and tooke boate from thence"
"for Guanno,[212] 7 leages. And paid at Mia 500 _gins_, and at Guanno"
"2300 _gins_, and to the servantes 200 _gins_. For we could get no"
"horses to goe from thence, although we arived theare at nowne, for"
"that all were taken up per them which came to vizit the princes. Our"
"host at Guanno tould me that it was strange to see the presentes which"
"came daylie to this noble man and his wife (she being the Emperours"
"doughter), for that all the noble men in Japon came to vizet hym"
"with presentes, som with 100 bars Oban and as many garments (I say"
"_keremons_), each one according to his degree. So that there was no"
"day passed without playes, I meane comodies or tragedies. So that the"
"rezort of people to that place was such that we could get no horse, etc."
