"_December 31._--This day Taccamon Dono sent againe to the hostes howses"
"of our junk offecers, charging them not to let the offecers departe"
"till I agreed to let the passingers passe in our junk. So I was forced"
"againe to get Capt. Adames to goe to the kyng, with our _jurebasso_"
"in his company, to complaine of the wrong Taccamon Dono doth us, our"
"junk being now ready to goe out. So the kyng gave order forthwith to"
"the hostes to let them goe. And sowne after Taccamon Dono sent to me"
"to exskeuse hym selfe, saying he was ill enformed of my matter by the"
"passingers, and therefore craved pardon. This Taccamon Dono is a prowd,"
"humerose, dreamyng fello."

"After dyner, Mr. Eaton went abord the junk to Cochy, and carid all the"
"marreners with hym; but the wether did groe so boysterous, and blew"
"soe hard a gale wynd, that they were in danger to have perished. And,"
"as report goeth, ther is above 30 barkes cast away, laden with rise"
"and other merchandiz, coming from Langasaque, Fingo, Xaxma, and those"
"partes, and all or most parte of people drowned."
